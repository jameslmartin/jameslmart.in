<h3>Hi, I'm James Martin</h3>
<p>I wear many hats but work with all sorts of backend technologies and data pipelines. I specialize in writing portable code for reproducible environments. I really enjoy working with Docker, Kubernetes, nginx, node, Python, Apache Airflow, and Jupyter. I'm happy tinkering with both digital and physical technologies.</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>I've spent time in an emerging technology research and development group at IBM and as a backend engineer in the Connected Fitness division of Under Armour. At IBM, I had the opportunity to work with some wonderful, smart people to automate training and deploying machine learning models. At Under Armour, I worked on almost all parts of two mobile app ecosystems, MapMyFitness and MyFitnessPal. I also spent some time product testing and providing feedback for the <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/gear/shoes/a25917965/under-armour-hovr-infinite-review/">HOVR</a> line of connected running footwear.</p>
<h4>Research</h4>
<p>My research in graduate school, <em>BS/MS in Computer Science, UNC Chapel Hill 2016</em>, centered around data science, application development, and accessibility. The output of my graduate thesis was <a href="https://jameslmartin.github.io/jupyter-a11y/"><code>nbreader</code></a>, an accessibility add-on for Project Jupyter.</p>
<h4>Pastimes</h4>
<p>I spend a lot of time away from a keyboard - I'm a big fan of the sun and being outside. While living in Central Texas, my friend Cole Weldon and I started an adventure cycling team, Ruffy Tuffy Crew. I'm a total bike and gear nerd, love trail running, and cook almost every meal with my partner Ariana. I have eclectic taste in music, enjoy simple board games, and general sporting, especially basketball. I love the intersection of design and all of these things.</p>
<h4>About this site</h4>
<p>jameslmart.in is a blog of my thoughts on a variety of topics built with Pelican and some hand rolled infrastructure. Most images are grainy because they are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither">dithered</a> to reduce file size with a Pelican plugin built by the good people at <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/">LOW‚ÜêTECH MAGAZINE</a>. Thanks for taking a look!</p>
