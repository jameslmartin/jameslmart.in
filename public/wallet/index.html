    <p>Cue Sam Jackson, "what's in your wallet?" My partner Ariana said I should do a short post on what I carry with me when I ride. I'm still living in like 2013 and running tubes even though my wheels are tubeless ready and I'm running 30mm WTB Exposure tires. I just don't have a good air compressor set up. Maybe I'll try a Tubibooster X from Topeak? I've heard mixed reviews about every charger pump.</p>
<p>I didn't photograph the <a href="https://roadrunnerbags.us/products/tool-saddle-roll?variant=12129584840805&amp;currency=USD&amp;utm_medium=product_sync&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_content=sag_organic&amp;utm_campaign=sag_organic&amp;utm_campaign=gs-2018-11-21&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=smart_campaign&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw9_mDBhCGARIsAN3PaFNr32CzTYump2aXtUrIwqWCQjkG4Jhmxi_wdDaa8Qha_oY2T0Mz12MaAvt8EALw_wcB">Road Runner toolroll</a> I keep under my saddle because it's less interesting. It usually contains:</p>
<ol>
<li>One 700x20-28mm (or whatever size less than 32) tube w/ a 60mm presta valve stem. I usually bring a handlebar bag/fanny pack on long rides so I'll put a second tube in there.</li>
<li>One Pedro's tire lever (I've had an up and down relationship with Pedro's but we're on really good terms now)</li>
<li>A canister of CO2 / nozzle applicator</li>
</ol>
<p>But, the main focus of this post:</p>
<p class="scalable-img"><img alt="Knolling of items I usually carry in a small wallet" src="https://jameslmart.in/dithers/scalable_knoll.png"/><span class="caption"></span></p>
<p>From left-right:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disassembled frame pump (Lezyne maybe?) - this thing comes apart and fits in the pouch without issue. For some reason, it works really, really well. I usually bring enough CO2 to not have to need it but sometimes if I get a slow leak and need enough air just to get home, this thing can do the job. Like most frame pumps, it does take some time to get up to ~60-80psi but I can imagine it will work just fine for tubeless set ups.</li>
<li>Bonding fluid for patches</li>
<li>Patch box - contains both clear-style and circular patches, small squares of sandpaper, small tire boots</li>
<li>Crankbrothers multitool - to be honest, I could probably carry a smaller multitool. This one works pretty well but have never had to use the chain breaker (knock on wood?)</li>
<li>Zipp valve extender - if you know, you know. If you've been on a group ride where you had to borrow a tube and the valve wasn't long enough for your sick aero hoops, you now carry one of these.</li>
<li>2mm allen key - I carry this in case I need to remove my brake pads</li>
<li>Zipp valve core remover</li>
</ol>
<p>The pouch itself is a Rapha wallet I found on eBay for much less than what it <a href="https://www.rapha.cc/us/en_US/shop/rainproof-essentials-case/product/LEC05XXBRI">costs new</a>. This has lasted me years but the zipper is in need of some oil. It fits perfectly in a middle jersey pocket and sits pretty flat even loaded up.</p>
