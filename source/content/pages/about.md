### Hi, I'm James Martin
I build software for a living. I am a backend software engineer by trade with a research background in Computer Science. Occasionally, I moonlight as a copyeditor for [Superorganism](https://superorg.ca).

I spend a lot of time away from a keyboard - I'm a big fan of the sun. While living in Central Texas, I started an adventure cycling team with my buddy Cole named Ruffy Tuffy Crew. I'm a bike and gear nerd, love trail running, and cook almost every meal with my partner Ariana. I enjoy eclectic music, simple board games, and athletics - especially basketball and World Tour pro cycling. I love the intersection of design and all of these things.

#### Technology
I'm comfortable working with backend technologies and data pipelines. I specialize in writing portable code for reproducible environments, and I most enjoy working with Docker, Kubernetes, nginx, node, Python, Apache Airflow, and Jupyter. I'm happy tinkering with both digital and physical technologies.

I spent time in an emerging technology research and development group at IBM and as an engineer at Under Armour Connected Fitness. At IBM, I had the opportunity to work with some wonderful, smart people to automate training and deployment of machine learning models. At Under Armour, I worked on almost all parts of two mobile app ecosystems, MapMyFitness and MyFitnessPal. I also product tested and provided feedback for the [HOVR](https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/gear/shoes/a25917965/under-armour-hovr-infinite-review/) line of connected running footwear.

I'm currently on the Backend Foundations team at [Guild Education](https://www.guildeducation.com/). I apply a combination of Guild-specific domain knowledge with my experience with AWS, serverless, and application programming to help our engineering organization stay aligned with best practices. My day-to-day involves research, coordination efforts, product management, and execution to provide resources for teams to effectively bootstrap and improve their projects.

#### Research
My research in graduate school, _BS/MS in Computer Science, UNC Chapel Hill 2016_, explored the intersection of data science, application development, and accessibility. The output of my graduate thesis was [`nbreader`](https://jameslmartin.github.io/jupyter-a11y/), an accessibility add-on for Project Jupyter.

#### About this site
jameslmart.in is a blog of my thoughts on a variety of topics built with Pelican and some personally managed infrastructure. Most images are grainy because they are [dithered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither) to reduce file size with a Pelican plugin built by the good people at [LOW&larr;TECH MAGAZINE](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/). Thanks for taking a look!
