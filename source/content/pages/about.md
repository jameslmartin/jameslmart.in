### Hi, I'm James
I wear many hats but work with all sorts of backend technologies and data pipelines. I specialize in writing portable code for reproducible environments. I really enjoy working with Docker, Kubernetes, nginx, node, Python, Apache Airflow, and Jupyter. I'm happy tinkering with both digital and physical technologies.

#### Background
I've spent time in an emerging technology research and development group at IBM and as a backend engineer in the Connected Fitness division of Under Armour. At IBM, I had the opportunity to work with some wonderful, smart people to automate training and deploying machine learning models. At Under Armour, I worked on almost all parts of two mobile app ecosystems, MapMyFitness and MyFitnessPal, and had the privilege of personally testing the [HOVR](https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/gear/shoes/a25917965/under-armour-hovr-infinite-review/) line of connected running footwear.

#### Research
My research in graduate school, _BS/MS in Computer Science, UNC Chapel Hill 2016_, centered around data science, application development, and accessibility. The output of my graduate thesis was [`nbreader`](https://jameslmartin.github.io/jupyter-a11y/), an accessibility add-on for Project Jupyter.

#### Pastimes
I spend a lot of time away from a keyboard - I'm a big fan of the sun and being outside. My friend Cole Weldon and I started an adventure cycling team, Ruffy Tuffy Crew. I'm a total bike and gear nerd, love trail running, and cook almost every meal with my partner Ariana. I have eclectic taste in music, enjoy simple board games, and general sporting, especially basketball. I love the intersection of design and all of these things.
