Summary: Thoughts in South Africa
Status: draft

I'm taking time away from working full time to travel a bit, recharge my creative batteries, and experience other ways of living. I'm reminded of the pretty on point satire from [Stuff White People Like](https://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com/2009/01/11/120-taking-a-year-off/) and I feel pretty lucky to take this time away. Something-something about the white protestant work ethic, something-something millenial burnout. Anyway... As I write this, I'm living and working on a few personal projects in Cape Town, South Africa. December 2019 involved lots of traveling throughout the country of South Africa and in the New Year my partner and I are slowing down, living in the city bowl, hiking and running a lot, eating homemade curry, and writing. Obviously staying somewhere for three months doesn't quite allow you to fully experience life as a local, but having a longer term stay has provided a much different experience than a weeklong "holiday."

Before I dive in, I want to note that South Africa is often described as "not Africa." South Africa is a wealthy nation but largely because it has a history complicated by colonialism. It's difficult to breeze over so much complexity but I at least hope to document some of my takeaways, I feel it's important to try to synthesize some of the daily life I've lived.

When we first arrived, my partner's younger brother was finishing a semester studying at the University of Cape Town.

1. You have a really great, well made cup of coffee made from African beans: TIA
2. You walk outside after having said cup of coffee and someone in rags begs you for something to eat: TIA

1. You walk into a shopping mall and purchase a months worth of cell data for around 5 USD: TIA
2. Outside the shopping mall, two men sitting on the street put their heads in a dirty garbage bag to have a hit of what is likely meth: TIA

1. You go on a beautiful hike for an hour starting from the door of your apartment and enjoy the Cape winds and warm sun: TIA
2. Walking back from said hike you get a rock thrown at your head by a man doing wash in a small urban settlement: TIA

Daily life in Cape Town is similar to the "western" world in a lot of ways... there are lots of posh shopping malls, people milling about food/farmers markets, cell service is good though wifi is pretty slow everywhere, people use new technology like Uber, etc. There are libraries and streets of bars for going out, there are places to run, gyms, swimming pools, well designed houses...

And then you realize that the population that can access these things people from the "west" take for granted is not even 1/5th of the population of the surrounding area. 400,000 people live in Cape Town proper, of which 32% are white. Roughly the equivalent population of Cape Town proper lives in a neighboring township, Khayelitsha. There are multiple townships that border Cape Town, but Khayelitsha specifically is 98% black African. Townships are not inherently "bad places"... they are communities formed out of the depths of deep rooted racism and oppression. When juxtaposed with the wealth of Camps Bay or some of the neighborhoods at the foot of the mountains in the city bowl, the level of economic exclusion and systemic racism is indescribable... it is astounding.

When you, a white person wearing clean clothes, walk down the street in Cape Town, it is immediately clear you have money. Even though my partner and I aren't wealthy by any western standards, the fact that we could afford a flight here and can afford to find lodging in Cape Town places us in a class of very privileged people.

Grappling with that privilege isn't easy. Thinking about what to do with that privilege is even harder. The people you meet every day on the street, the Uber drivers, or shopkeepers are all friendly but there exists a division between "tourist" and "local" not often breached. When people hear that I'm staying until mid-February, they are usually positively surprised. Two months and change is obviously not equivalent to being born and raised in Cape Town but there are many more mind numbingly wealthy tourists that stay for a week, enjoy the favorable exchange rate, then bounce back to Russia or the UK. Very few people have the opportunity to peel back layers of such a complex and historical city.

A few times, I've considered following the lead of the wealthy tourists, packing up, and going home. If everywhere I go I wear my privilege on my sleeves and if I'm contributing to a system/economy that excludes so many people, why be here? If being in a community for eight weeks achieves nothing or only benefits the already wealthy, why participate? If I have to constantly be vigilant about my personal belongings and surroundings, why live here? There might be brilliant sunshine, beaches, hiking, and running here in Cape Town, but there's an undercurrent that reminds me how privileged I am to be able to enjoy these things. I have socks in my boots. I can do these things and not worry about feeding myself or having a safe place to sleep. I think packing up and leaving would be more of disservice. It's too easy to go back to the States or Canada and slip back into the coddled bliss of consumerism and I've come too far to go back so soon.

When we went on a four day safari, the two trackers of the camp enthusiastically taught a one-hour crash course on "survival" skills in the bush, given you had nothing on your person. The way they talked about living in the bush was entirely nonchalant. "Oh, when you sleep, you gather branches from acacia trees that have been stripped of leaves by elephants, place them in a circle around you, and light a fire you'll be great!" That's why I put "survival" in quotes. It never seemed like it was a scary task. The African bush is much friendlier than the Texas savannah. Things may be _able_ to kill you, but hardly anything is _trying_ to kill you.

"Lions and rhinos and elephants know the scent of humans, they don't like you so they won't bother you! Hyenas are the only thing you have to look out for but if you make your shelter they won't be able to jump the branches to bother you. Snakes and scorpions will avoid you too!" Temba, a senior tracker, says living in the bush was a daily part of life growing up. You don't pack food or water with you in the bush, you gather it as needed. This sort of mentality gives some clarity on how a lot of Africans live their daily lives... things are gathered as needed. TIA.

What stands out to me more now is the abundance of marketing in the west. After staying in Cape Town for a few weeks.

All this considered, there is a deeper, internal realization. This isn't just Africa, this is the States, too. It's similar to Charleston, where the remnants of slavery leave black communities living on the margins selling sweetgrass baskets to afford food and school supplies. The cycle repeats when land is taken away from black people that have lived on it for hundreds of years. A system that white people created, deeds and boundaries and zoning, isn't compatible with land sharing, ancestral bestowments, etc. Whether or not any of these systems are intentional is an exercise for the reader and an entirely separate discussion... the reality is they exist and the prevailing systems benefit white people.

Learning how to navigate this system we live in today's world in Cape Town directly translates to how we live in the US. Learning how to build community and find good people in Cape Town directly translates to how I would do that anywhere else in the world. Being street smart in Cape Town translates to being street smart in New York, or Los Angeles, or Paris...
